Really what we should do in the example above is use more descriptive variable names, but even then it would still be possible for a large code base to use a variable name more than once in different places, so namespaces help reduce the chance of name conflicts.\n",

This can be useful if we know that we'll be using a few things from a module many times, but not using anything else from the same module, since it allows us to skip typing `np.` in front of that variable every time we use it.
